    There's a saying that your first post has to be somewhat stupid, isn't there?
    There probably isn't but who actually cares.

Hello world. It is me, Simon. First of all, how did you end up here?
Doesn't matter, you're welcome anyway. Just so you know, this post isn't being
written with the goal of conveying a message or even being useful in any form or
way. No, the sole purpose of this post is to ... exist.

You know, you might think that that's not a very good goal, but at least
I can't fail something as simple as that.

So hey, whatever you're doing here, thanks.
